I installed VS code and worked on it. 
I learned the short cuts to efficiently use VS code and its tools: 
                      For windows Ctrl + B to toggle the sidebar menu.
                      Ctrl + shift + D to debugging.
                      Ctrl + shift + F to search and replace.
Learned to create new file and to write code.
Extensions that are usefull in VS code:
(prettier) -> for format on while saving.
(cobalt 2) -> for theme.
(advance new file) -> to create new file using command.
(Live serve) -> for launch a development local server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages.
(Quokka) -> Gives JavaScript playground and TypeScript.
(Bookmarks) -> for marking lines and jumping to them.
Learned to Run and Debug.

Comment in Javascript Code:
            -> Comments are lines of code that Javascript will intentionally ignore.
            -> They’re just used to create notes for yourself and others about what the code does
            -> // : makes an in-line comment
            -> Eg : // in-line comment example   : This is inline comment
            -> Eg : /* this is a multiline
                       comment line 1     : This multi-line comment
                       line 2
                       line 3 */
            -> We can have multiple lines in multiline comment.

Data types and variables:
            -> Data is anything that is meaningful to the computer.
            -> Javascript provides seven different data types
            -> Data Types:
                     Undefined, Null, Boolean, String, Symbol, Number, and Object.
            Undefined:
                  -> It is something that hasn’t been defined.
                  -> It may have a variable that haven’t set to be anything yet
            Null:
                -> Null means nothing.
            Boolean:
                -> A boolean means true or false
            Symbol:
                -> A symbol is an immutable primitive value that is unique.
            String:
                -> A string is just any sort of text
            Number:
                -> A number is a number.
            Object:
                -> An object can store a lot of different key value pairs.
            -> Varaibles:
                    -> A variable allows computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion.
                    -> It’s basically a label to point to the data.
                    -> To declare a variable, one way is to use the var keyword.
                    -> Var stands for variable
                    -> Eg : var myname = "Javascript"   : this is string datatype
                    -> There are actually three ways to declare a variable in Javascript.
                              1) var myname = "Javascript"   : A var is going to be able to be used throughout your whole program.
                              2) let ourname = "JS"   : Let will only be used within the scope of where you declared that.
                              3) const pi = 3.14   : Const is a variable that should never change. It can never change.
                    
Storing Values with Assignment Operator:
                    -> There’s a difference between declaring variables and assigning variables.
                    -> Eg : var a;   : Here it is declaring a variable to be called a.
                            var b = 2;   : Here it is declaring and assigning in one line.
                    -> And then the equals sign is the assignment operator.        
                    -> Eg : a = 7   : we've assigned a to be 7
                            b = a   : now assigned the contents of a to b.

-> console.log(content)  : It allows you to see the content in the console.

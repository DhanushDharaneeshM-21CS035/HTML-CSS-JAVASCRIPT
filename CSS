CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
        -> CSS is something which is used to style websites or style HTML.
        -> Cascading means anything that you apply to an upper element goes down to any lower elements or any elements that are inside other elements.
        -> So anything that you apply to the body element will cascade or get be inherited to all the  other elements on the page.
        
Inline Styles:
        -> Inline styles are where we style something right on the element that we want to effect.
        -> <p style="color:any color we want;">   ->changes the colour of text of that paragraph
        -> Eg: <p style="colour: blue;">some text</p>.

Styling classes :
                -> <h2 class="red-text"> : using style class
                -> <style>       : creating style class
                    .red-text{
                      color:red;
                    }
                   </style>
                -> Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements
                ->  So to show that you're styling  a class, you would put a dot in front of it.
             
Selectors to Style elements:
        -> <style></style> : Style block
        -> <style>
               p {color:red;}
           </style>
->This code changes the color of text present inside a paragraph tag

Style Multiple Element with a CSS class:
                -> The same CSS styles on multiple HTML elements
                -> <h2 class="red-text"> : using style class
                -> <p class="red-text">   : another usage of style class
                -> <style>       : creating style class
                    .red-text{
                      color:red;
                    }
                   </style>

Change the Font Size of an Element:
                Eg: -> <style>       : creating style class
                         .red-text{
                           color:red;
                           font-size: 30px;   : Changes the font size
                         }
                       </style>
                    -> <style>
                        p{      : another example
                          font-size:16px;
                        }
                       </style>
                      
Set the FOnt Family of an Element:
                -> It can set which font in element should use by  using the font family property.
                -> Eg: -> <style>
                            p{      
                              font-size:16px;
                              font-family: monospace;
                            }
                          </style>

Import a Google Font:
        -> We can import fonts from different websites, a free library of web fonts that we can use is Google fonts , they have a lot of great fonts.
        -> <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> : This code comes directly from the Google Fonts website.
        
Specify How fonts should degrade:
                -> This are the some default fonts available in all browsers, like monospace, serif and sans serif.
                -> when one font isn't available, we can tell the browser to degrade or default to another font.
                -> Eg: -> <style>
                            p{      
                              font-size:16px;
                              font-family: Lobster,monospace;   : degrade or default to another font when if one is not available , it will go to the next font.
                            }
                          </style>
                        
Size your Images:
        -> Css has a property called width that controls an element width.This can apply to almost any type of element, like an image or a div, or paragraph.
        -> Eg: -> <style>
                    .large-image{
                       width: 500px;      : increases the size of the iamge 
                    }
                  </style>
                  <a href="#"><img class="large-image"></a>
               -> <style>
                    .large-image{
                       width: 100px;      : decreases the size of the iamge 
                    }
                  </style>
                  <a href="#"><img class="smaller-image"></a>

Add Borders around your Elements:
              -> Css borders have properties like style, color and width.
              -> Eg: -> h2{
                          font-family: Lobster,monospace;
                          border-color: red;
                          border-width: 5px;
                          boder-style: solid;
                        }
                     -> <style>    : creating class
                                .thick-green-border{
                                        border-color: green;
                                        border-width: 10px;
                                        boder-style: solid;
                                }
                        </style>
                        <a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-broder"></a>

Add Rounded Corners with border-radius:
                -> Border radius property can used to make that a little rounded corners in borders
                -> Eg: -> <style>    : creating class
                                .thick-green-border{
                                        border-color: green;
                                        border-width: 10px;
                                        boder-style: solid;
                                        border-radius: 10px;   little curved corners
                                        (or)
                                        border-radius: 50%;   : makes a circle
                                }
                          </style>
                          <a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-broder"></a>

Give a Background Colour to a div Element:
                -> The element background color can be set, with a property called background color.
                -> Eg: -> <style>
                            p{     
                              font-family: Lobster,monospace;
                              background-color: blue;
                            }
                          </style>
                       -> <style>
                                .silver-background{
                                        background-color: silver;
                                }
                          </style>
                          <div class="silver-background">

Set the id of an Element:
                -> We can also style based on ID and id is similar to a class except each element is only going to have one ID classes.
                -> Eg: <form id="cat-photo-form" action="/submit-cat-photo">  : applying an ID to an element

Use an id Attribute to style an Element:
                -> Id have higher priority than classes.
                -> And should only have one ID per element
                -> Eg: -> <style>
                                #heading{
                                        colour: green;
                                }
                          </style> 
                          <h2 class="red-text" id="heading">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Adjust the Padding of an Element:
                -> There are three properties that control the space around each element, which is padding margin and border.
                -> Padding: The padding is the space around the text.
                -> Margin: The margin is the space outside of the border that surrounds the padding
                -> Padding is adjusted using padding keyword

Adjust the Margin of an Element:
         -> Elements merging controls the amount of space between an elements border and the surrounding elements    
         -> Eg: margin: 20px;
         
Add a Negative Margin to an Element:
         -> Setting negative value to margin keyword make the margin big because it has negative margin       
         -> Eg: margin: -15px;

Add Different Padding to Each Side of an Element:
                -> we're going to use different paddings for the different sides using, top padding, right padding, bottom padding, left paadding.
                -> Eg: Different padding:
                         padding-top: 40px;
                         padding-right: 20px;
                         padding-bottom: 20px;
                         padding-left: 40px;
                      
Add Different Margins to Each Side of an Element:
                -> we're going to use different margin on each side, we have margin top, margin right, margin bottom, margin left. 
                -> Eg: Different margin:
                         margin-top: 40px;
                         margin-right: 20px;
                         margin-bottom: 20px;
                         margin-left: 40px;
                  
Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Padding:
                -> Eg: padding: 20px 40px 20px 40px;   : These four numbers are which the first number is the top, then the right, then the bottom, then the left.
                
Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Margin of an Element:
                -> Eg: margin: 20px 40px 20px 40px;    : There's four numbers. The first is the top, right, bottom, and then left.
                
Use Attribute Selectors to Style Element:
                -> Eg: -> [type='radio']{    : Here attribute is type and value is radio
                                margin: 20px;
                          }
                       -> [type='checkbox']{
                                margin: 10px 0px 15px 0px;
                          }
                
Understand Absolute versus Relative Units:
                -> Like px or pixels, these are absolute types of  length.
                -> Absolute types of length like include, in  - inches, mm - millimeters, px - pixel, these are all tied to physical units of length.
                -> Relative units of length like em and rem. And these are relative to another link value.
                -> em - Relative to the font-size of the element.
                -> rem - Relative to font-size of the root element.
                -> Eg: .red-box{
                             padding: 1.5em;
                       }
                
Style the HTML Body Elements:
                -> Every HTML page has a body element.
                -> Eg: <style>
                           body{
                                background-colour: black;
                           }
                       </style>
                -> This turns the whole page black.
                
 Inherit Styles from the Body Element:
                -> So anything that you apply to the body element will cascade or get be inherited to all the  other elements on the page
                -> Eg: <style>
                           body{
                                background-colour: black;
                                colour: green;
                                font-family: monospace;
                           }
                       </style>
                       <h1>Hello World</h1>
                       -> we have green monospace font applied to h1 tag.
                
Prioritize One Style Over Anothe:
                ->  The way style works is it uses whichever one is more specific or mentioned.
                -> Eg: <style>
                           body{
                                background-colour: black;
                                colour: green;
                                font-family: monospace;
                           }
                           .pink-text{
                                colour: pink;
                           }
                       </style>
                       <h1 class="pink-text">Hello World</h1>
                       -> We have pink monospace font applied to h1 tag.
                
Override Styles in Subsequent CSS:
                -> The order that does matter is the order that the styles declared in.
                -> Eg: <style>
                           body{
                                background-colour: black;
                                colour: green;
                                font-family: monospace;
                           }
                           .pink-text{
                                colour: pink;
                           }
                           .blue-text{
                                colour: blue;
                           }
                       </style>
                       <h1 class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World</h1>
                       -> We have blue monospace font applied to h1 tag due to the order on which the styles are declared in.
                
Override Class Declarations by Styling ID Attributes:
                      -> IDs are even more specific.
                      -> Eg: <style>
                                body{
                                    background-colour: black;
                                    colour: green;
                                    font-family: monospace;
                                }
                                #orange-text{
                                        colour: orange;
                                }
                                .pink-text{
                                        colour: pink;
                                }
                                .blue-text{
                                        colour: blue;
                                }
                              </style>
                              <h1 id="orange-text" class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World</h1>
                              -> We have orange monospace font applied to h1 tag, Because IDs are specific.
                
Override Class Declarations with Inline Styles:
                        -> Inline styles are going to be more specific than all these other ways of styling text.
                        -> Eg: <style>
                                body{

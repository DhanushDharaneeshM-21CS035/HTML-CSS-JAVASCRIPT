DOM (Document Object Model):
      -> Dom represents the content of an XML or HTML document as a tree structure.
      -> Dom is a programming interface or an API.
      -> Using Dom, we can easily read, access and update the content of the document.
      -> Dom convert XML into a tree structure internally in the memory.
     
D => Document -> Files
O => Object   -> Tag elements of the file
M => Model    -> Layout or structure

-> Document Object Model or Dom represents the content of XML or HTML documents as tree structure.
-> It can be used to easily read, access and update the contents and is a programming interface or an API.
-> It represents the document as a tree structure internally in the memory and can be used with programming languages like JavaScript
-> Then by using the Dom functions like get elements by tag name, we can access the element.
-> All XML elements can be accessed through the XML DOM
-> Eg:
      xmlDoc.getElementsByTagName("title")[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue;
-> This code retrieves the text value of the first <title> element in an XML document.
-> DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
